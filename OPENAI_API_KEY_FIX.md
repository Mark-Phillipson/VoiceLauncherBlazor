# OpenAI API Key Configuration Fix

## Problem
The AI Chat component in the WinFormsApp was showing an empty OpenAI API key, preventing the chat functionality from working.

## Root Cause
The WinFormsApp's `Program.cs` was only loading `appsettings.json` but not the environment-specific configuration files like `appsettings.Development.json`, where the actual OpenAI API keys were stored.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Configuration Loading in Program.cs
Modified the configuration builder in `WinFormsApp/Program.cs` to:
- Detect the current environment (defaults to "Development")
- Load `appsettings.json` first (base configuration)
- Load `appsettings.{environment}.json` as an overlay (environment-specific configuration)
- Include environment variables as a fallback

```csharp
var environment = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT") ?? "Development";

Configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory)
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{environment}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
    .Build();
```

### 2. Created appsettings.Development.json for WinFormsApp
Added the development configuration file with the actual OpenAI API key:
- `SmartComponents:ApiKey` - Primary configuration path used by the AI Chat component
- `OpenAI:ApiKey` - Fallback configuration path

### 3. Configuration Hierarchy
The AI Chat component now checks for the API key in this order:
1. `SmartComponents:ApiKey` (from appsettings.Development.json)
2. `OpenAI:ApiKey` (fallback from appsettings.Development.json)
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (system fallback)

## Files Modified
- `WinFormsApp/Program.cs` - Updated configuration loading
- `WinFormsApp/appsettings.Development.json` - Added with actual API key
- `WinFormsApp/appsettings.json` - Cleaned up placeholder values

## Testing
The application now properly loads the OpenAI API key from the development configuration file, enabling the AI Chat functionality in the WinFormsApp.

## Security Note
The actual API key is now stored in `appsettings.Development.json` which should not be committed to version control in production scenarios. For production deployment, consider using:
- Environment variables
- Azure Key Vault
- User secrets for development
- Other secure configuration providers
