# Implementation Summary: VS Code Projects Launcher Feature

## Overview
Implemented a new launcher category type "VS Code Projects" that allows launching Visual Studio Code with specific project folders directly, eliminating the need to create workspace files for every project or manually navigate to directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Functionality Changes

#### RazorClassLibrary/Pages/LauncherTable.razor.cs
- **Modified Method**: `ProcessLaunching(int id)`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added category type detection logic
  - Added VS Code project handling that executes `code "<folder-path>"`
  - Changed HTTP link check from `if` to `else if` to support new branching logic
- **Lines Changed**: Added ~25 lines of code

#### RazorClassLibrary/Pages/LauncherTableFavourites.razor.cs
- **Modified Properties**: Added `private List<CategoryDTO> _categories` field
- **Modified Method**: `LoadData(bool forceRefresh = false)`
  - Added loading of all categories for type checking
- **Modified Method**: `LaunchItem(LauncherDTO launcher)`
  - Added category type detection logic
  - Added VS Code project handling
  - Changed HTTP link check from `if` to `else if`
- **Lines Changed**: Added ~30 lines of code

### 2. Documentation

#### VS_CODE_PROJECTS_FEATURE.md
- Comprehensive user guide with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Examples and use cases
  - Troubleshooting section
  - System requirements
  - Implementation details

### 3. Testing

#### TestProjectxUnit/VSCodeProjectsLauncherTests.cs
- Created 4 unit tests:
  - `VSCodeProjectCategory_ShouldBeDetectedCaseInsensitive()` - Tests case-insensitive detection
  - `VSCodeProjectCategory_ShouldHandleNullCategory()` - Tests null category handling
  - `VSCodeProjectCategory_ShouldHandleNullCategoryType()` - Tests null category type handling
  - `VSCodeProjectLauncher_ShouldHaveValidCommandLinePath()` - Tests launcher validation

## How It Works

1. **Category Detection**: When a launcher is activated, the system checks if its category type is "VS Code Projects" (case-insensitive)
2. **VS Code Launch**: If detected, executes `code "<folder-path>"` instead of standard process execution
3. **Fallback**: If not a VS Code project, uses existing launcher logic (HTTP navigation, markdown viewer, or process start)

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Category Setup
CategoryType = "VS Code Projects"

// Launcher Setup
Name = "Voice Launcher Blazor"
CommandLine = "C:\Projects\VoiceLauncherBlazor"

// Execution Result
Process: code "C:\Projects\VoiceLauncherBlazor"
```

## Benefits

1. **No workspace files needed**: Launch any project folder directly
2. **Voice-optimized**: Perfect for hands-free workflow with Talon Voice
3. **Minimal changes**: Only ~55 lines of code added across 2 files
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing launchers continue to work unchanged
5. **Consistent**: Works in both main launcher table and favourites view

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code installed
- `code` command available in system PATH (auto-configured on Windows during VS Code installation)

## Testing Status

- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Unit tests created (4 tests covering main scenarios)
- ⚠️ Unit tests cannot run in current environment due to network restrictions (huggingface.co blocked)
- ✅ Code logic verified through manual inspection

## Files Modified

1. `RazorClassLibrary/Pages/LauncherTable.razor.cs` - Added VS Code project detection and launching
2. `RazorClassLibrary/Pages/LauncherTableFavourites.razor.cs` - Added VS Code project detection and launching

## Files Added

1. `VS_CODE_PROJECTS_FEATURE.md` - Comprehensive user documentation
2. `TestProjectxUnit/VSCodeProjectsLauncherTests.cs` - Unit tests

## Commits

1. Initial plan for VS Code project launcher feature
2. Add VS Code Projects launcher feature
3. Add unit tests for VS Code Projects launcher feature
4. Enhance VS Code Projects feature documentation with comprehensive guide

## Next Steps for User

1. Create a category with type "VS Code Projects"
2. Create launchers for your projects with folder paths in the CommandLine field
3. Launch projects via voice commands or UI
4. Optionally configure Talon Voice commands for quick access

## Notes

- The implementation is minimal and surgical, changing only what's necessary
- The feature integrates seamlessly with existing launcher infrastructure
- Case-insensitive matching ensures flexibility in category type naming
- Error handling ensures graceful failure if VS Code is not available
