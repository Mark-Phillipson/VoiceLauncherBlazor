# Voice Admin

* This repo contains a Blazor server side application which includes a To Do section and provides the functionality to maintain some speech recognition related database tables. 

* The tables are used in conjunction with Microsoft Azure and a c# application to provide extra functionality when coding by voice, like Custom IntelliSense that can be called upon by voice from any application.

An example screenshot of commands follows:

* Also provided by the tables is the ability to launch any application, folder or website.

* Functionality also exist to Search and filter Visual Studio Menu commands. These can then be used with the following Visual Studio extension to activate by voice:
