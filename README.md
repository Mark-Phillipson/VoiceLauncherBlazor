# Voice Launcher Blazor

This repo contains a Blazor server side application which includes a to do section and provides the functionality to maintain some speech recognition related database tables.

The tables are used in conjunction with KnowBrainer scripts to provide extra functionality like Custom IntelliSense that can be called upon by voice from any application.

Also provided by the tables is the ability to launch any application, folder or website.

  
There are also calendars/schedules that use DevExpress Blazor controls
