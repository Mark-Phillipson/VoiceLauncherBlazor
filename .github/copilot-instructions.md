# Copilot Instructions for VoiceLauncherBlazor

## Project Overview

- **Blazor Server Application**: The main project is a default Blazor Server app.
- **Blazor Hybrid WinForms Project**: Includes a Blazor Hybrid project using WinForms for desktop integration.
- **Component Structure**: Blazor components are organized with both front (`.razor`) and code-behind (`.razor.cs`) files. There are eight main components, each following this pattern.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap is used for consistent and responsive UI styling.
- **Accessibility**: The application is developed for hands-free use and enhanced accessibility, optimized for use with Talon Voice and the Cursorless Visual Studio Code Extension.

## Development Practices

- **Component Organization**: Each Blazor component consists of a `.razor` file (markup/UI) and a `.razor.cs` file (logic/code-behind).
- **Component Placement**: 
  - **CRITICAL**: All new Blazor components, models, and services should be created in the `RazorClassLibrary` project, NOT in the main `VoiceLauncher` project.
  - When creating new features like TalonAnalysis, TalonImport, etc., place all related files in the appropriate folders within `RazorClassLibrary`:
    - Components: `RazorClassLibrary/Pages/` (with both `.razor` and `.razor.cs` files)
    - Models: `RazorClassLibrary/Models/`
    - Services: `RazorClassLibrary/Services/`
  - The main `VoiceLauncher` project should only contain program startup logic and dependency injection configuration.
  - If components are accidentally created in `VoiceLauncher`, they must be moved to `RazorClassLibrary` and all references updated.
- **CSS Isolation**: Always use CSS isolation files (`.razor.css`) for component-specific styles instead of inline `<style>` tags. This provides better separation of concerns, scoped styling, and maintainability.
- **Styling**: Use Bootstrap classes for layout and controls. Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Provide `aria-` attributes where appropriate.
  - Ensure all controls are reachable and operable via voice commands and keyboard navigation.
- **Hands-Free Development**:
  - Codebase is structured for compatibility with Talon Voice and Cursorless.
  - Use clear, descriptive names for files, components, and methods to facilitate voice navigation.
- **Hybrid Integration**: The WinForms project hosts Blazor components using the BlazorWebView control.

## Tools

- **Talon Voice**: For hands-free coding and navigation.
- **Cursorless (VS Code Extension)**: For rapid, voice-driven code editing.
- **Visual Studio / VS Code**: Main IDEs for development.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the component structure and naming conventions.
- Ensure all UI changes maintain or improve accessibility.
- Test new features with Talon Voice and Cursorless workflows.
- Use Bootstrap for all styling unless a specific exception is required for accessibility.

## General Behavior
 -When running things in the terminal do not keep creating new terminals try to use the existing one!

## Build Configuration
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use Debug builds when testing or building the application.
- **Unit Tests**: Use XUnit for unit testing. Ensure all tests pass before committing changes. Project Name: TestProjectxUnit
-  do not create console apps to run tests 
- **DO NOT use Release builds** as they can break existing applications that depend on this codebase.
- When building the solution, use: `dotnet build --configuration Debug`
- Avoid commands like `dotnet build --configuration Release` or any Release configuration builds.

## Entity Framework Migrations
- Create the commandline  commands for copying pasting
- Do not run the commands directly
- Always create a script and do not use "Update Database."

## Database Configuration
- **Database Type**: SQL Server (not SQLite)
- **Entity Framework**: Uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server provider
- **Connection**: The application connects to a SQL Server database
- **SQL Syntax**: When writing SQL queries, use SQL Server T-SQL syntax, not SQL Server syntax
- **Examples**:
  - Use `SELECT TOP 10` instead of `LIMIT 10`
  - Use `ISNULL()` instead of `IFNULL()`
  - Use SQL Server date functions like `GETDATE()` instead of SQLite equivalents

## Deployment Guidelines

Note: This application is currently built for Markâ€™s personal use.

Blazor Server: Deployed using the dotnet publish command from the command line.

Blazor Hybrid WinForms: Deployed by running the build command in Release mode.

## Talon Lists and Captures

 Please note that in talon files a talon capture will be enclosed in {}  and a talon list will be enclosed in <>

## Important Current Process

Currently we are embarking on making changes to the talon voice commands server project only any other changes to any other projects like the razor class library should be avoided at all costs it's fine to read these other projects but do not make any changes because they currently work.
