Title: Implement Blazor WASM with IndexedDB for Talon Voice Commands

Branch: wasm-indexeddb (create a new branch off main)

Labels: enhancement

Description:

Implement a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application that uses IndexedDB for local storage of Talon voice commands and lists. This implementation should follow the outlined architecture and repository abstraction to ensure seamless integration with existing services.

Notes:
- Create a new branch from `main` named `wasm-indexeddb` for the work.
- Ensure the implementation lives in the `RazorClassLibrary` project where applicable, following project conventions.
