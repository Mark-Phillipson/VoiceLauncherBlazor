I would like to build a new Blazor component that can be pointed at a image or photograph that shows various faces and has the ability to assign names to the faces for later callback for memory purposes.

  it would be beneficial to be able to store the whole image but record where the faces are and what the first names are.

   we should be able to type a name into a search box and the relevant face should be highlighted in the image.

    also we should be able to hover over a imaged  face and see the name assigned to that face.

     can we add this feature and build a playwright test to demonstrate it working?
