The talon voice command search works but only directly after I've done an import if I refresh the page and then try it has no results does it need to load up the commands first? If so can you add that functionality?


 please note that we are talking only about the single project that is not linked to anything else despite repeated code and the project name is talon voice commands server.

  please only report back when this is working

   please see the screenshots for more information

    please do not make any changes to anything other than the TalonVoiceCommandsServer Project!
