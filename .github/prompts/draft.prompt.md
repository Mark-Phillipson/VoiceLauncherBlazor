I would like to introduce a new feature to the application so that when there is no value in the search TextBox and no filter set and no autoFilter by app turned on the application will use javascript to pull out six random can voice commands and display one at a time in a loop without any user interaction.  this should just occur naturally after the form has not been used for a couple of minutes.
