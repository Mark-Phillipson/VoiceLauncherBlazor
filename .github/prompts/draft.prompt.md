I have a lot of projects that I need to keep track of and open up with Visual Studio code by voice.

 currently I'm having to open up terminal and navigate to the relevant directory code .

  I have some that I have included a  workspace file and are already included and the launcher functionality

   other than creating a workspace file for lots and lots of projects can you suggest another mechanism whereby I can have eight category of Visual Studio code project and a way to directly launch Visual Studio code based on the folder structure?

    note I also have a category for folders were it will launch the file explorer at the specific file location so don't want to mix up with thiscode .
