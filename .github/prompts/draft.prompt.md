Could we add the analysis now I would like to have a breakdown of the number of talon voice commands in each repository and the number of talon lists in the system.

 The analysis will be displayed on a new component called TalonVoiceCommandAnalysis.razor

 The data resides in the IndexDB database in the TalonVoiceCommands and TalonLists object stores.

  The changes we're making are pertaining just to the TalonVoiceCommandsServer project.
