please create a new Github issue with the following content:


The talon voice command search works but only directly after I've done an import if I refresh the page and then try it has no results does it need to load up the commands first? If so can you add that functionality?

Also, Can we make the breakdown report hidden by default and appear in eight tab of its own so you've got search commands and import scripts and we could have analysis in the middle.

 the problem with the search not working after a page refresh is still a persistent problem that we have not been able to fix thus far please work on this.

As I'm sure you're going to can you create a new branch to work on this problem.

 please note that we are talking only about the single project that is not linked to anything else despite repeated code and the project name is talon voice commands server.
