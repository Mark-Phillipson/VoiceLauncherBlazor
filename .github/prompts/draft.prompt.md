When the list search button is clicked can we hide the search commands and just show the talon voice command search component.  it is still showing in the user interface!

 Also can we add access keys to the search button and the two search TextBox so we can keyboard focus it easily by voice and also display what the access keys making sure we don't use ones already used by the browser
