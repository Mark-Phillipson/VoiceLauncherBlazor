Please create a new later component in the razor class library to provide the functionality to search and filter the talon lists

 the user should be able to filter by talon list namealso talon list values

  create this as a separate component in the Razor class library with the following page url: /talon-lists

   I guess we are also going to need the talon list repository and a talon list data service

    when filtering the search results should include a label saying how many results were found

     by default the lists should be displayed alphabetically and the list values also should be displayed alphabetically
