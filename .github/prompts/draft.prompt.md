Utilizing the existing infrastructure can we add the ability to have a launcher item point to a markdown file and display it as HTML in a Blazor component?

Essentially utilizing the LauncherTable.razor component to display a list of markdown files and when one is clicked it opens a new component that renders the markdown as HTML. This would be useful for cheat sheets located in repositories on my hard drive.
