# Test Results Summary — Deprecated Standalone Server Tests Removed

NOTE: The tests and artifacts in this file were specifically about the standalone TalonVoiceCommandsServer project and its localStorage persistence fixes. That project is no longer maintained, and the associated Playwright tests and scripts were removed.

If you need to reintroduce similar end-to-end tests, consider targeting the active project (e.g., `VoiceAdmin`) and updating paths and configuration to match current development standards.
