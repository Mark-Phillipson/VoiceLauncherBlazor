echo "=== MANUAL TEST STEPS ==="
echo ""
echo "1. Start the standalone TalonVoiceCommandsServer:"
echo "   cd TalonVoiceCommandsServer"
echo "   dotnet run --configuration Debug"
echo ""
echo "2. Open browser to: http://localhost:5269"
echo ""
echo "3. Navigate to Import page: http://localhost:5269/talon-import"
echo ""
echo "4. Set directory path to: $TEST_DIR"
echo ""
echo "5. Click 'Import All From Directory' button"
echo ""
echo "6. Navigate to Search page: http://localhost:5269/talon-voice-command-search"
echo ""
echo "7. Search for 'open file' - you should see results"
echo ""
echo "8. **CRITICAL TEST**: Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)"
echo ""
echo "9. Search for 'open file' again - results should still appear"
echo ""
echo "10. If step 9 works, the localStorage persistence is fixed! ✅"
echo ""
echo "=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ==="
echo "✅ BEFORE FIX: Search would fail after page refresh"
echo "✅ AFTER FIX: Search works both before AND after page refresh"
echo ""
echo "=== TECHNICAL DETAILS ==="
echo "The fix includes:"
echo "- Enhanced EnsureDataIsLoadedForSearch() with retry logic"
echo "- Improved EnsureLoadedFromLocalStorageAsync() error handling" 
echo "- Cache invalidation after import operations"
echo "- Progressive backoff for localStorage loading"
