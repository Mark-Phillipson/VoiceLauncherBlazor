pdeI can see the issue. The TalonDuplicateAnalyzer project is missing a Main method. Let me check the current state of the Program.cs file and fix it: The file is empty! Let me recreate it with the proper conflict analysis code: 

Made changes.

Now let's build and run the analyzer to get the conflict analysis: Perfect! Now we have the focused conflict analysis you were looking for. Here's what the analysis found:

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Conflicting Duplicates Found**

### **Global Command Conflicts (30 found)**
These are the most problematic because they're the same voice command for global use but from different repositories with different implementations:

**High Priority Conflicts:**
1. **"zoom out"** - `mystuff` uses `key(ctrl--)` vs `community` uses `edit.zoom_out()`
2. **"search"** - `mystuff` uses `key(ctrl-f)` vs `community` uses `key(/)`
3. **"go to"** - `mystuff` uses `key(ctrl-g)` vs `community` uses `"goto "`
4. **"new line"** - `mystuff` uses `key(enter)` vs `community` uses `"\n"`

**Debugging Conflicts:**
- **"step into"**, **"step over"**, **"step out"** - Different implementations between `mystuff` (function keys) and `community` (user functions)

**Navigation Conflicts:**
- **"previous tab"** / **"next tab"** - Different key combinations between repositories
- **"go left"** / **"go right"** - `community` uses `edit.left()` vs `mystuff` uses `key(left)`

### **Application-Specific Conflicts (4 found)**
These are conflicts within specific applications:
- **VSCode conflicts** - `[go] implementation`, `focus editor`, `step over`, `pilot toggle`

## ðŸ“Š **Summary Statistics**
- **Total conflicting commands**: 34
- **Global conflicts**: 30 (most critical)
- **App-specific conflicts**: 4
- **Most problematic repositories**: `mystuff` (40 conflicts) and `community` (32 conflicts)

## ðŸ”§ **Recommendations**
1. **Priority 1**: Resolve the 30 global command conflicts - these will cause voice command ambiguity
2. **Decide on implementations**: Choose between `mystuff` and `community` versions for each conflict
3. **Consider renaming**: Use different voice triggers for conflicting commands
4. **Consolidate**: Merge similar functionality where possible
5. **Use app-specific commands**: Move global commands to specific applications when appropriate

This analysis shows exactly the type of conflicting duplicates you were concerned about - same voice commands that could cause confusion or unpredictable behavior in Talon Voice.
